			<p>Content Data app current functionality includes a list of set / fixed date ranges that users can filter to view their pager related content data.</p>

			<p>This list currently includes:</p>

			<ul class="no-bullets govuk-list">
  			<li>Past 30 day (the default option users see in their interface)</li>
  			<li>Past month</li>
  			<li>Past 6 months</li>
				<li>Past year</li>
			</ul>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The problem</h2>

	      <p>Some users find the set date options limited as they don’t allow them to filter and view content data within their preferred timeframes. These time frames could be dependent on a. receiving requests for viewing content data within a specific timeframe  b. wanting to track a specific campaign outside the set ranges c. compare data before and after a specific content change.</p>

				<p>One user with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) stated that they would like to have the date range that they picked visible at all times without needing to refer back to the date selection input fields to make their experience easier and not get overwhelmed by having to refer back to the data pickers. </p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we gathered those insights </h2>

				<p>Through the Content Data app user experience survey_August 2022.</p>

				<p>These are also supported by secondary desk research into needs and pain points with Content Data app users conducted years ago.</p>


			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Current limitations</h2>

				<p>We don’t have concrete evidence as to how old the data need to be. One user stated up to 3 plus  years. </p>

			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">User needs</h3>

				<p>As a user of Content Data when I perform a data search I need to be able to set custom date ranges so that I can search and view data within a timeframe that is useful to me and allows me to track data fitting to my content changes.</p>

				<p>As a user of Content Data with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when I view my data search results I need to have the chosen date range visible at all times so that I am not getting confused and needing to click the date input fields to remind myself.</p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Outcome</h2>
